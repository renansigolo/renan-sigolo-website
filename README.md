# Renan Sigolo Website

## 🐣 Getting Started

If you're configuring this app for the first time you'll need to follow a few step:

### Environment variables

Grab the `.env` variables from the vercel server

```bash
vercel env pull
```

> You will need the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) installed on your local machine

## 🛠 Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.

## 🌍 Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
